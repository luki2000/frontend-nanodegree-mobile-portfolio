The main attraction of the site is our (extremely) colorful pizzeria web page which is mobile and tablet friendly! We worked hard to make the experience speedy and jank free. I know you are impatient so please click on the last project link or visit the site at:

Straight away as the page loads you will see a picture of our local pizzeria restaurant with some juicy information about the great range of foods. If you are in a rush and would like to see specific information about our site you are in luck, follow these instructions:

1. Go to the top left of the page where you can see four grey tabs.
2. To see the menu, click menu which will take you to the 'Menu' list.
3. Interested in the ingredients? Click ingredients which is the second tab.
4. Want to know where we are? Click on the third tab called 'Locations'.
5. If you are just interested in contacing us, Click the last tab 'Contact Us'.


Our menu is changing everyday so be sure to check our menu list frequently, we offer 3 ifferent sizes which you can visually see for yourself, to do that simply:

1. Scroll down to 'Our Pizzas!' title. 
2. You will see a slider towards the left that is already set on medium (middle).
3. Slide to the right to see bigger pizzas.
4. Slide to the left to see smaller pizzas.

That is all! Thank you for your time!
